# home-assistant-android-icon-map

Generates a variant of [MDI](https://materialdesignicons.com/)'s icon meta file. This includes IDs used by [icondialoglib](https://github.com/maltaisn/icondialoglib), which was previously used inside Home Assistant for Android.

- icondialoglib's ID mapping and MDI's icon metadata is fetched from GitHub.
- Running `generator.js` will generate a new copy of `icon_meta.json` and `mdi_id_map.json`.
